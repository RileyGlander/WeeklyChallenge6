## Description
- What was your motivation? What motivated me was finding a way to learn more about API keys and adding them so any user can find the weather with a simple and functioning weather search tool.
- Why did you build this project? I built this project so I could find the weather for any city I search for easily and effectively.
- What did you learn? I learned that API's are a very useful tool that offer flexibility and saves time compared to those wanting to do it from scratch.


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
It's as simple as heading over to the 'Enter a city' search bar, typing in the city you want to find the weather for and clicking the 'Submit' button.

## Known issues
All weather data is displayed only in the console.
Anytime you type something and submit it, it will show up in the console.
Everytime you click the submit button a message will appear saying "This is where I will fetch weather"
